# fastapi-google-translator
To implement the solution to build a microservice with FastAPI using google translator, googletrans was used in its version 3.0.0. For the persistent layer, MongoDB was used as a database and pymongo library in version 4.3.3 for connection and management. As possible improvements there could be better exception handling, greater depth in the scope of the parser, endpoint documentation, refactoring and the calculation of memory consumed.
The application was developed with FastAPI, MongoDB and the Dockerfile and Docker Compose files for deployment.
